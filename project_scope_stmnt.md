# Project Scope Statement for Float ATX, a boat rental business on Lake Travis.

## Project Purpose:

### Why are we doing this project?

> FLoat ATX is a new boat rental company launching on Lake Travis im Austin, TX, specializing in Sea-doo Switch Cruise rentals. Right now the business doesn't have much of an online presence, which limits the ability to gain customers. We need to be able to:
- Showcase our Sea-Doo Cruise boats
- Accept online reservations
- Establish credibility
- Compete with other local boat rental companies

> This website will be the main place our customer's first interact with the company, which means it needs to be informative and appealing.
