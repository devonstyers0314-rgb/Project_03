# Project Scope Statement for Float ATX, a boat rental business on Lake Travis.

## Project Purpose:

### Why are we doing this project?

> FLoat ATX is a new boat rental company launching on Lake Travis im Austin, TX, specializing in Sea-doo Switch Cruise rentals. Right now the business doesn't have much of an online presence, which limits the ability to gain customers. We need to be able to:
- Showcase our Sea-Doo Cruise boats
- Accept online reservations
- Establish credibility
- Compete with other local boat rental companies

> This website will be the main place our customer's first interact with the company, which means it needs to be informative and appealing.

### Who needs to provide feedback and when/how?

**Key Stakeholders:**
- **Business owner**: Float ATX needs to approve all content, pricing info, and brand representation before going public with the site. 
- **Target Customers**: Tourists and Austin locals that want to enjoy a day on the water, without the long term commitment of buying a boat.
- **Legal advisor**: A full liability waiver and correct insurance/legal disclaimers should be reviewed by professionals.
