## Project Purpose:

### Why are we doing this project?

> FLoat ATX is a new boat rental company launching on Lake Travis im Austin, TX, specializing in Sea-doo Switch Cruise rentals. Right now the business doesn't have much of an online presence, which limits the ability to gain customers. We need to be able to:

- Accept online reservations
- Establish credibility
- Compete with other local boat rental companies

> This website will be the main place our customer's first interact with the company, which means it needs to be informative and appealing.

### Who needs to provide feedback and when/how?

**Key Stakeholders:**
- **Business owner**: Float ATX needs to approve all content, pricing info, and brand representation before going public with the site. 
- **Target Customers**: Tourists and Austin locals that want to enjoy a day on the water, without the long term commitment of buying a boat.
- **Legal advisor**: A full liability waiver and correct insurance/legal disclaimers should be reviewed by professionals.

## Priorities

### How to prioritizew (1 = most important)

**Time**: 2
- **Constraint**: Must launch before peak summer rental season (by June 1, 2026)
- **Flexibility**: Some flexibility exists
- **Impact**: Launching late means missing early summer bookings

**Quality**: 1 **MOST IMPORTANT**
- **Constraint**: Website must look professional and trustworthy
- **Flexibility**: No flexibility - a poorly designed or buggy website will damage brand credibility 
- **Impact**: This is a customer-facing business website representing a premium rental service. Quality directly correlates with customer trust and booking possivility

**Budget**: 3
- **Constraint**: Self-developed website with $0 budget
- **Flexibility**: Most flexibility - can use free hosting platforms initially (GitHub Pages)
- **Impact**: While a larger budget could speed up developments or add better features, a good free website is more than capable

**Rationale**:
> Quality is #1 because an unprofessional website could hurt the business by making it look fake or unsafe, especially for an activity with inherent risks like boating
Float ATX's website project will deliver a professional, mobile-responsive two-page website that establishes the business's online presence and enables potential customers to learn about Sea-Doo Switch Cruise rentals on Lake Travis. The project prioritizes quality over speed and budget, ensuring the website builds trust and credibility with potential customers. With a March 1, 2026 deadline, clear stakeholder roles, and well-defined success criteria, this project will provide Float ATX with the digital foundation needed to launch a successful boat rental business for the summer 2026 season.

**Next Steps**:
1. Gather all content boat specs, pricing, and photos
2. Begin HTML structure development
3. Create CSS styling page
